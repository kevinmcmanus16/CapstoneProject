# An Analysis on the Relationship between Weather and Crime in Chicago, IL

This project completes my capstone research project for my Masters Degree in Data Analytics. This project is used to see how weather affected types of crimes committed in Chicago from 2014-2020.


The compressed crime dataset files ).7z) should be extracted and combined into a single file for use in the R programming code, along with downloading the weather.csv file. 
Naming conventions will likely need to be modified to match the user's file path for the import, in addition to modifying the write csv file for the merged dataset. 

Once the R program has successfully run, the SAS program can be opened. 
Again, naming conventions will likely need to be modified for this program based on where the write csv file occurred. 


This project answers the following questions:

RQ 1: Is there a relationship between all external weather factors and the types of crimes committed?
    H0 1: There is not a relationship between all external weather factors and the types of crimes committed.
    HA 1: There is a relationship between all external weather factors and the types of crimes committed.

RQ 2: Is there a relationship between the maximum temperature for the day and the types of crimes committed?
    H0 2: There is not a relationship between the maximum temperature for the day and the types of crimes committed.
    HA 2: There is a relationship between the maximum temperature for the day and the types of crimes committed.

RQ 3: Will one or more weather variables be able to predict the type of crime committed?
    H0 3: One or more weather variables will not be able to predict the type of crime committed.
    HA 3: One or more weather variables will be able to predict the type of crime committed.
